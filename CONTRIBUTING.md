# Contributing Guidelines

## Branch Naming Convention

When creating a new branch for a feature or task, please adhere to the following naming format:

- **Format**: `/feature/{name-of-your-task}`
- **Description**: Replace `{name-of-your-task}` with a descriptive, lowercase name that succinctly summarizes the task you're working on, with words separated by hyphens.

### Examples:
- `/feature/add-login-functionality`
- `/feature/update-documentation`

## Commit Guidelines

Ensure that your commit messages are clear, concise, and follow these rules:

- **Start with a Past Tense Verb**: Begin each commit message with a verb in the past tense, capitalized.
- **Clarity and Brevity**: The message should clearly describe the changes made in a concise manner.

### Examples:
- `Added user authentication logic`
- `Refactored database connection code`
- `Fixed bug in payment gateway integration`

## Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

Adhere to these guidelines when making a Pull Request:

- **Title**: Keep the PR title simple yet descriptive, reflecting the task being addressed.
- **Description**: The PR should include a brief description that clarifies the changes made and their purpose.
- **Squash and Merge**: PRs must be squashed and merged into the `main` branch. Direct merges are not allowed.
- **Review Requirement**: A PR needs at least two reviews before merging.
- **No Direct Pushes**: Direct pushes to the `main` branch are prohibited.
- **Testing Compliance**: All tests must pass before merging a PR. Make sure your code complies with existing tests and add new tests if necessary.
